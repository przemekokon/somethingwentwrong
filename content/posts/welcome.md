## Welcome to SomethingWentWrong.dev

If you work in IT long enough, you develop a special relationship with error messages.

That moment when you run a script in production and see:
```powershell
Get-Mailbox : The operation couldn't be performed because 
object 'user@domain.com' couldn't be found
```

Or when the output looks like this:
```powershell
@{DisplayName=John Doe}
@{DisplayName=Jane Smith}
```

Because you forgot `-ExpandProperty`. Again.

## What This Blog Is About

I'm an IT architect working with Microsoft 365, PowerShell, and Power Platform.

This blog documents:
- Real problems from production environments
- Step-by-step solutions (more or less)
- What went wrong along the way
- Lessons learned the hard way

## What You Won't Find Here

- Generic "10 PowerShell tips" articles
- Copy-pasted Microsoft docs
- Solutions that only work in labs
- Perfect code that never fails

## Coming Soon

I'm documenting some recent projects:
- Building an enterprise vacation calendar in Power Apps
- Automating M365 license compliance
- Debugging DMARC alignment at scale

Spoiler: A lot went wrong. But that's what makes it worth writing about.
