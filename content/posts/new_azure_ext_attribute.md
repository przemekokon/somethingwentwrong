.SYNOPSIS
    Adds users from a TXT file to an Entra ID Group via Microsoft Graph.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script reads UPNs from a text file, resolves each user (first by UPN,
    then by mail as fallback), and adds them to the specified group.
    Works with both Security Groups and Microsoft 365 Groups.

.PARAMETER GroupId
    Object ID of the target Entra ID Group.

.PARAMETER FilePath
    Path to the TXT file containing one UPN per line.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Add-GroupMembers.ps1 -GroupId "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" -FilePath ".\users.txt"
