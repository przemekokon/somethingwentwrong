## Hi, I'm Przemek

I'm an IT architect specializing in Microsoft 365, PowerShell automation, and Power Platform solutions.

By day, I manage email infrastructure and automation systems for a large enterprise. By night (and weekends), I document the interesting problems I encounter.

## Why This Blog?

Every complex IT project has a story - the things that went wrong, the unexpected behaviors, the workarounds that became permanent solutions.

Microsoft documentation is great for the happy path. This blog is for everything else.

## What I Write About

- **PowerShell automation** at enterprise scale
- **Power Apps & Power Automate** patterns and gotchas  
- **Exchange Online** administration and troubleshooting
- **Email security** (DMARC, DKIM, SPF implementations)
- **Azure** integrations and automation
