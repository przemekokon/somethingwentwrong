## Hi, I'm Przemek

Something went wrong and I became an engineer instead of a nepo baby.

By day, I manage cloud infrastructure and try to automate things for a large enterprise. By night, I document the problems that made me question my life choices.

## Why This Blog?

I'm still figuring that out. 

If I come up with something that sounds good on LinkedIn, I'll update this section.
